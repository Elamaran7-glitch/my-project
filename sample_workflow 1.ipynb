      "\n",
      "1. **Initialization:** The code sets up connections to BigQuery and Vertex AI using service account credentials. It also initializes ChromaDB for vector storage and loads the specified Vertex AI text generation model. \n",
      "2. **Functions:**\n",
      "   - `generate_text`: This function takes user input and generates text using the Vertex AI text generation model.\n",
      "   - `get_context_from_bigquery`: This function retrieves relevant information from a BigQuery database based on the provided query. \n",
      "   - `get_relevant_context`: This function retrieves relevant context from the vector database (ChromaDB) based on the user's question. \n",
      "   - `add_document_to_db`: This function adds new information (documents) to the vector database along with their corresponding embeddings.\n",
      "3. **Chatbot Loop:**\n",
      "   - It retrieves context from BigQuery using a predefined query.\n",
      "   - It adds the fetched context to the vector database.\n",
      "   - It takes the user's question, converts it into an embedding, and queries the vector database to retrieve the most similar pieces of information (relevant context).\n",
      "   - It combines the user's question with the retrieved context and sends it as a prompt to the Vertex AI text generation model. \n",
      "   - It displays the model's generated response to the user. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Improvements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Modular Design:** The code is structured into functions to improve readability and reusability.\n",
      "- **Context Retrieval:**  The chatbot now retrieves relevant context from BigQuery based on the user's question.\n",
      "- **Vector Database:** ChromaDB is used as a vector database to efficiently store and retrieve information based on semantic similarity. \n",
      "- **Embeddings:** Vertex AI's `text-embedding-gecko` model is used to generate embeddings for text, enabling semantic search in the vector database. \n",
      "- **Dynamic Prompting:** The chatbot constructs prompts dynamically by combining the user's question with relevant context.\n",
